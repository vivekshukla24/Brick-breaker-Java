# Brick-breaker-Java
A classical Brick Breaker game based on simple Java programming. I made this as a simple college project with my friends for 2nd semester.

In our day-to-day life we are always busy and stressed because of work and rush in the modern world. So, we made a game just enjoy and spend some time to relax and chill out of 
the busy world. We made a typical brick breaker game coded in java, in which the user has to destroy all the bricks present in that level using the ball. The main aim of the 
player to is to control the ball using the paddle at the bottom. The player will have to move the paddle using left and right arrow keys to move the paddle and save the ball from 
going out of the frame. In this project we have used the java as our main program language and for the backend we have used the oracle database for storing and updating playerâ€™s 
scores.
